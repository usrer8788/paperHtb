# Paper Hack the Box notes
This will contain all my notes during this hack the box exercise.

Prerequisites:
- I have connected to the hack the box vpn service

- Have my note taking workflow ready



# Initial Recon
## NMAP:
**First Scan**
The first NMAP scan, we were able to find 3 ports were open (22,80 and 443). This meant we could look at the webpage being hosted.
